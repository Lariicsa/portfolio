## Montebit Documentation

**Tools**: `Gitlab, Markdown, AdobeXD, Zeplin, Trello, Monday, Postman, GoogleDocs`

At Montebit I staterd developing complete frontend of one of main eCommerce in the Holding. Then when I started leadeing frontend area I developed guidelines, user manuals, developer setup documentation and testing manuals for new members in teams.
Also I trained Jr Testers in team to maintain documentation and tests and mentored new frontend members in team.

**What I used:**

- Gitlab environmet tools for documentation and versioning conyrol.
- Notion for Frontend documentation like components, guidelines, styles, etc.
- Figma to manipulate and modify some images
- Github for versioning and manage projects and files
- Trello and Jira to track tasks and tests


## How I helped

After some time and Frontend development I could understand complete project as Backend as Frontend so now I can document detailed in project (setup, Databases, variables, functions, components, CSS, etc). Adding to this, I have enhanced frontend components, pages and other details.

The knowledge of Systems and I.T. environments let me communicate clearly and consice with most of coleagues like
Project Manager, Developers, stakeholders, sellers, community managers and the team in warehouse.
