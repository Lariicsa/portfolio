## BajaTechnologies Documentation

**Tools**: `Notion, Markdown, Figma, Github, Trello, Jira`

At BT I started as a Frontend developer at Latouraine Inc (adult entertainment software client), where I developed from scratch the UI for a social media project, after 2 years due to the demand for documentation, I decided to participate in the creation, maintenance and correction of documents, guides and rules for the project.

Currently I'm using:

- Confluence for global documentation like Hosts, setup, files, variables, etc.
- Notion for Frontend documentation like components, guidelines, styles, etc.
- Figma to manipulate and modify some images
- Github for versioning and manage projects and files
- Trello and Jira to track tasks and tests


## How I helped

After some time and Frontend development I could understand complete project as Backend as Frontend so now I can document detailed in project (setup, Databases, variables, functions, components, CSS, etc). Adding to this, I have enhanced frontend components and functions.
