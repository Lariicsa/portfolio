## BajaTechnologies Documentation

:wrench: **Tools**: `Notion, Markdown, Figma, Github, Trello, Jira`

At BT I started as a Frontend developer at Latouraine Inc (adult entertainment software client), where I developed from scratch the UI for a social media project, after 2 years due to the demand for documentation, I decided to participate in the creation, maintenance and correction of documents, guides and rules for the project.

**What I'm using:**

- Confluence for global documentation like Hosts, setup, files, variables, etc.
- Notion for Frontend documentation like components, guidelines, styles, etc.
- Figma to manipulate and modify some images
- Github for versioning and manage projects and files
- Trello and Jira to track tasks and tests


## How I helped

After some time and Frontend development I could understand complete project as Backend as Frontend so now I can document detailed in project (setup, Databases, variables, functions, components, CSS, etc). Adding to this, I have enhanced frontend components, pages and other details.

The complete underestanding of environment, stack and projects let me be supported by team members (project manager, testers, developers, CTO anddevops) to create high level documentation.
