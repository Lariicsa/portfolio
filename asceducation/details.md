## ASC Education Documentation

:wrench: **Tools**: `Wordpress, Jekyllrb, Material Design, Github, Postman, AdobeXD, Zeplin, Confluence`

At ASC I started as a UX/UI Designer, after a few months I started developing some frontend components, got requirements to design wireframes and UI designs.
And for each frontend environment I created documentation and style guides.

**What I used:**

- Github for documentation and version management.
- Confluence for documentation
- AdobeXD to manipulate and modify some images
- Zeplin to create wireframes and UI designs
- Postman to test APIs
- Wordpress and Jekyllrb to create system documentation


## How I helped

Once I started as a UX/UI Designer and after developed some frontend components I started with Frontend documentation. So then with my skills as a designer and with my IT knowledge, it was easy for me to create high quality user documentation and frontend documents for developers.
